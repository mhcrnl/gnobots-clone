 -GameDisplay.java (6 hours)
   Created the methods createBoardPanel, createButtonPanel, createStatusPanel
   Made the GameDisplay constructor
   Set up the action listeners and basically "initialized" by creating the
   conditional for each one.
   Solved the mystery of why none of the labels added to the panel were not 
   being displayed, as well well as the logic behind how exactly the pieces
   were "moving" around the board (that is, that they are really just icons
   added to each label)
